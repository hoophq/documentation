### New Features

**RDP Everywhere**

> _Beta release, not supported in our this version's Kubernetes deployement_

You can now connect to RDP endpoints directly through Hoop with proper credential handling and access checks. Sessions automatically expire when credentials do, keeping things secure.
PRs [#1101](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1101), [#1102](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1102)

**TLS Termination**

Gateway and database connections (Postgres, RDP) now fully support TLS termination — with transparent fallback and backward compatibility.
PR [#1096](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1096)

**SSM Exec Agent Script**

Run ad-hoc commands or open interactive sessions over SSM directly from your agent.

### Enhancements

**Data Masking & MySQL Improvements**

The agent got smarter with redaction:

 - Propagates data masking entities to the MySQL native protocol
 - Supports parallel redaction of text row chunks
 - Tracks redaction statistics for visibility
 - Simplifies MySQL authentication handling and error propagation

PR [#1105](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1105)


**UX & Misc Enhancements**

- Pagination added to connection lists ([#1076](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1076))
- Guardrails configuration now sent to terminals ([#1104](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1104))
- Runbooks now show extension info in empty state ([#1103](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1103))


TLS, RDP, and redaction — all playing nicely together.
Your connections just got faster, safer, and a lot more flexible. 🛡️
