### TL;DR
- **New Features:** Opt-in Anonymous Tracking, Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl + K), Agent Daemon Mode
- **Bug Fixes:** MySQL Session Kill, MongoDB Schema, API Key Propagation, Jira Re-run

---

### New Features

#### Opt-in Anonymous Tracking
Admins are now prompted with a consent form to enable anonymous tracking within Hoop.
This allows us to improve the product with analytics while ensuring no identifiable data (including yours) is collected.

[PR #1007](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1007) and [PR #1011](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1011)

---

#### Command Palette Interface
Search and navigate faster with the new command palette — just hit `Cmd + K` on macOS or `Ctrl + K` on Windows/Linux in the Hoop web app to open it.

[PR #1008](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1008)

---

#### Agent Daemon Mode
Users can now run the Hoop Agent as a daemon for smoother, always-on operations.
We also added support for a new agent command to manage it easily.

[PR #997](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/997)

### Bug Fixes
We smashed some bugs recently, too. Here's what died:

- MySQL sessions can now be killed properly (community report)
- Terminal page connections list now scrolls correctly
- API Key propagation no longer drops calls
- MongoDB schema tree browsing works without hiccups
- “Re-run session” option removed from Jira integrations
- MongoDB integration is now sturdier and more compatible across edge cases

---

### Experience Boosts
- **Command Palette:** Less clicking and faster searching
- **Agent Daemon Mode:** Smoother rides with fewer restarts
- **Opt-in Tracking:** Analytics that are optionally anonymous
- **Bug Fixes:** Fewer hiccups all around

---

The theme for this release is **faster, lighter, and friendlier.**
See you in a couple of weeks with more.
