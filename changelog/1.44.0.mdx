### New Features

**Resources and Roles System ([#1120](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1120))**

This release introduces a fundamental shift in how Hoop manages connections. The new Resources and Roles architecture brings structure, clarity, and fine-grained access control to your infrastructure.

**What's a Resource?**
Resources are now first-class objects that represent your infrastructure components (databases, servers, APIs). Each resource can have multiple roles with different access levels and configurations.

**What's changed:**
- **Multi-step Setup Wizard** — Four-step guided flow: configure your resource, select an agent, define roles with specific permissions (web terminal, native access, data masking), and confirm creation
- **Resource Management Panel** — New dedicated UI to view, filter, and manage all your resources in one place with type-based organization
- **Role Configuration System** — Each resource can have multiple roles with different configurations — think dev vs prod access, or read-only vs full permissions
- **Integrated Agent Selection** — Pick and configure agents during setup instead of managing them separately
- **Unified Terminology** — "Connections" are now "Resource Roles" throughout the platform, making the relationship between resources and access patterns crystal clear

**Key benefits:**
- Create one resource, configure multiple roles for different teams or use cases
- Eliminate scattered connection configs — everything lives under its parent resource
- Guided setup prevents configuration mistakes and missing required fields
- See your entire infrastructure at a glance with the new resource catalog
- Transaction-based creation ensures resources and roles are created atomically

### Enhancements

**Command Palette Updates**

The command palette now supports resource role selection with enhanced filtering controls, making navigation even faster.

**Infinite Scroll & Pagination**

Connection listings now use infinite scroll with smart loading states, handling large infrastructures smoothly.

**Improved Search & Filtering**

Search functionality expanded to include resource names, status filters, and debounced queries for better performance.

### Technical Improvements

- Resource name validation ensures unique identifiers
- Transaction support for atomic resource and connection creation
- Updated data models with resource subtypes
- Enhanced credential handling for metadata-driven and custom configs
- Insecure SSL toggle for HTTP proxy connections

Version 1.44.0 redefines how Hoop manages infrastructure. Resources and Roles bring the organization and access control that growing teams need, wrapped in a setup experience that actually feels good to use.

This is the foundation for everything coming next.
