### TL;DR
- **New:** Microsoft Presidio data masking for MongoDB
- **Enhanced:** RDP connection architecture
- **Fixed:** Stale data persisting when switching between connections
- **Improved:** Connection metadata download error handling

### New Features

**MongoDB Data Masking with MS Presidio**

Microsoft Presidio is now integrated for MongoDB connections, bringing enterprise-grade data masking to your MongoDB workflows. We also refactored the MongoDB DLP implementation to align with the current masking architecture across all databases.

### Enhancements

**RDP Connection Architecture ([#1084](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1084))**

RDP connections are now configured as custom type with `rdp` subtype, providing more flexibility and consistency with other connection types.

**Connection Metadata Script ([#1099](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1099))**

Improved the connection metadata download script with better HTTP status handling and JSON validation. Added clear error messages for common issues (403, 404, 429) to make troubleshooting easier.

---

### Bug Fixes

**Connection Form State Persistence ([#1100](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1100))**

Fixed a synchronization issue where editing a connection in the terminal and then switching to configure a different connection would retain data from the first one. Connection details now load synchronously, ensuring clean state when switching between connections.

If you noticed old data appearing in connection forms, this fixes it.

Security meets stability — MongoDB gets smarter masking, and connection management gets cleaner.
