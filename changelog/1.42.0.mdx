### New Features

**Runbooks Dedicated Page ([#1054](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1054))**
Runbooks finally have their own space. Navigation is cleaner, organization is simpler, and teams can find what they need faster.

**Resources Catalog ([#1050](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1050))**
Creating and managing connections just got an upgrade.
The new Resources Catalog keeps metadata, documentation, and UI definitions perfectly aligned through Decap CMS, so every setup stays consistent and predictable.

**Presidio Pre-installed Everywhere**
Every deployment now ships with Presidio by default, giving teams built-in data masking without extra configuration.

- **Command Palette Shortcut ([#1057](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1057))** — You can now open cmd + K straight from the sidebar search for faster navigation.
