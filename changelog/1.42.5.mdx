description: "Terminal fixes and a solid foundation for what's coming next. We squashed navigation bugs and built out the resources infrastructure to power better connection management."

### TL;DR
- **New:** Resources model for enhanced connection management
- **Fixed:** Terminal "database not found" error from connection list
- **Fixed:** Keyboard shortcuts in custom/command-line connections

### New Features

**Resources Model ([#1083](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1083))**

Added a new resources model that lays the groundwork for improved connection management. This infrastructure enhancement includes routes, agent association, and role-based defaults — setting the stage for more flexible resource handling.

### Bug Fixes

**Terminal Navigation & Editor Shortcuts ([#1090](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1090))**

Fixed two issues that were disrupting the Web Terminal experience:

- **Database navigation error** — Opening a database connection from the connection list no longer triggers a "database not found" error. The schema cache now clears properly on connection selection.

- **Editor shortcuts** — Keyboard shortcuts (like Ctrl+Enter) now work reliably in custom and command-line connection types. We removed faulty caching logic in CodeMirror extensions initialization.

If you were frustrated by either of these, they're gone now.

Smoother terminals and stronger foundations.
