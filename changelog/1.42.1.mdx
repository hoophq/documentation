### Bug Fix

**HTTP Proxy Environment Variables ([#1073](https://github.com/hoophq/hoop/pull/1073))**

Fixed a critical bug where environment variables and headers couldn't be properly accessed in the HTTP proxy connection setup. The issue prevented index-based operations on environment variables due to improper data structure handling.

**What changed:**
- Environment variables now initialize correctly as vectors
- Headers processing properly filters the `INSECURE` variable
- Improved error handling when environment-variables collection is empty or nil

If you experienced issues configuring HTTP proxy connections, this fixes it.

A small but mighty fix. Back to smooth sailing.
