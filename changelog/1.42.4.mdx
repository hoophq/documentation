### TL;DR
- **Improvement:** Simplified Redis connection setup by removing mandatory authentication fields

---

### Improvement

**Simplified Redis Connection Setup ([#60](https://github.com/hoophq/documentation/pull/60))**

Redis connections no longer require username and password fields during setup. The authentication parameters (`--user` and `-a`) have been removed from the default configuration, making it faster to connect to Redis instances that don't use authentication.

**What changed:**
- Removed mandatory `USER` and `PASSWORD` fields from Redis connection form
- Simplified `redis-cli` command to only require host, port, and database number
- Faster setup for development and local Redis instances

This change makes Redis connections more flexible — perfect for dev environments and instances without authentication enabled.

Less friction, faster connections.
