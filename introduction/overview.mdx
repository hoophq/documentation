Hoop.dev is an access gateway for databases and servers with AI-powered automations that eliminate cumbersome access policies and break-glass workflows without compromising security. Our platform provides secure, auditable, and easy-to-manage access to your infrastructure.

## The Challenge of Infrastructure Access
Organizations face significant challenges when managing access to critical infrastructure:

Security risks from overly permissive access policies
Productivity bottlenecks from complex approval workflows
Compliance headaches due to inadequate audit trails
Visibility gaps in understanding who accessed what and when
Sensitive data exposure risks during access sessions

Hoop.dev addresses these challenges by providing a secure gateway that sits between your users and your infrastructure, delivering zero-config security features that protect your resources while streamlining access for developers.
