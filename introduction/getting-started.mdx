Hoop.dev is an access gateway for databases and servers with AI-powered automations that eliminate cumbersome access policies and break-glass workflows without compromising security. Our platform provides secure, auditable, and easy-to-manage access to your infrastructure.

## The Challenge of Infrastructure Access
Organizations face significant challenges when managing access to critical infrastructure:

- Security risks from overly permissive access policies
- Productivity bottlenecks from complex approval workflows
- Compliance headaches due to inadequate audit trails
- Visibility gaps in understanding who accessed what and when
- Sensitive data exposure risks during access sessions
