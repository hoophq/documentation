## Authentication

The authentication process requires either an **access token** or an **API key** to interact with the gateway.
The following sections outline the various authentication scenarios when using the command line interface.

<Note>
  The authentication process requires knowing the gateway instance URL where the Hoop gateway is running.
  Our managed instances are hosted under the URL:

  ```
  https://use.hoop.dev
  ```

  Contact your administrator if you have a self hosted installation and don't know this information.
</Note>

### Connection Usage Scenario

This authentication method is recommended for users who need to regularly access and manage resources within their permission scope.
Users will authenticate to obtain a valid access token, which remains active based on your identity provider's expiration policy.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self Hosted">
    This command should be executed only once in your machine.
    It creates and wipes the file `$HOME/.hoop/config.toml` in your local machine

    ```sh
    hoop config create --api-url https://yourgateway-domain.tld
    ```

    This command must be executed every time the token expires or the command above is executed.

    ```sh
    hoop login
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Managed Instance">
    When running the command line interface for the first time, it will create the configuration file `$HOME/.hoop/config.toml` and prompt you to set the default gateway URL.
    Your browser will automatically open and redirect you to our identity provider.
    Subsequent authentication attempts will open your browser and update the access token in your configuration file.

    After completing authentication, your `config.toml` will contain a valid access token for continued use of the command line interface.

    ```sh
    hoop login
    ```

    ```
    Press enter to leave the defaults
    API_URL [https://use.hoop.dev]:
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Automation Usage Scenario

## Programmatic API Access

This authentication method is designed for administrators who need programmatic access to the API for tasks such as managing connections,
configuring policies, or executing operations within automation pipelines.

Programmatic access requires static authentication credentials that can be obtained through the following methods:

### Static API Key

A Static API Key provides persistent authentication by setting an environment variable in the gateway with a secure random string.

Configure the token in your local configuration using this command:

```sh
HOOP_TOKEN=<api-key> hoop config create --api-url https://yourgateway-domain.tld
```

- Refer to the [API Key Usage for more information](/setup/apis/api-key)

### Service Account

Service Account authentication is available if your identity provider supports the
[OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant type](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/client-credentials/).

```sh
export HOOP_TOKEN="$(/tmp/issue-client-credentials-token-from-idp.sh)"
hoop config create --api-url https://yourgateway-domain.tld
```

<Note>
  Access tokens obtained from your identity provider typically have an expiration period.
  To maintain continuous access, create a script that can generate fresh access tokens as needed.
</Note>

- Refer to the [Service Account Usage guide for more information](/setup/apis/service-accounts).

### Using Environment Variables

Another way to use the command line is by exporting the following environment variables:

```sh
export HOOP_APIURL=https://use.hoop.dev
export HOOP_GRPCURL=grpcs://use.hoop.dev:8443
export HOOP_TOKEN=<your-access-token-or-api-key>
export HOOP_TLSCA=file:///path/to/ca.pem
# test it
hoop admin get userinfo
```

When using environment variables, it will ignore the local configuration file `$HOME/.hoop/config.yaml`

## Managing Configuration

- Configure your Gateway URL and clear any existent configuration

```sh
hoop config create --api-url https://yourgateway-domain.tld
```

- Configure the Gateway URL and the gRPC URL

```sh
hoop config create
  --api-url https://yourgateway-domain.tld \
  --grpc-url grpcs://yourgateway-domain.tld:443
```

<Note>
  This flag is optional and used only to interact with connections.
  The `--grpc-url` is obtained automatically from the Api when a user Sign In (issue the `hoop login` command)
</Note>

- Configure the Gateway URL, the gRPC URL and the TLS Certificate Root Certificate

```sh
hoop config create
  --api-url https://yourgateway-domain.tld \
  --tls-ca=file:///tmp/ca.pem

# inline configuration
hoop config create
  --api-url https://yourgateway-domain.tld \
  --tls-ca="base64://$(cat /tmp/ca.pem |base64)"
```

<Note>
  This option should be used if your gateway is running with self signed certificates.
</Note>

- Show `API_URL`, `GRPC_URL` and `TLS_CA` configuration

```sh
hoop config view
```

- Show all configuration with the access token (contains sensitive information)

```sh
hoop config view --raw
```

- Show sections of configuration

```sh
hoop config view api_url
hoop config view grpc_url
hoop config view token
hoop config view tls_ca
```

- Wipe Local Configuration

```bash
hoop config clear
```

## Interacting with Resources

The `hoop connect` command allows you to create an interactive session with a remote resource.
The resource include the interactive terminal console or native protocols.

### Terminal Console

- docker exec
- bash
- ssh
- rails console
- python console
- kubectl exec
- aws ecs execute-command

```bash
hoop connect bash-console
connection: bash-console | session: 53ed53f9-a5f9-45e9-bbf5-becd1f44f41e
root@5601881aa15e:/app#
```

### Terminal Ad Hoc Executions

Permit triggering ad hoc executions on a connection.

- Issue the command `env` to a connection with the `bash` as interpreter

```sh
hoop exec bash -i 'env'
```

- Run the script `/tmp/myscript.sh` using `bash` as the interpreter

```sh
hoop exec bash -f /tmp/myscript.sh
```

- Run the script `/tmp/myscript.sh` by reading it from the standard input using `bash` as interpreter

```sh
hoop exec bash <<EOF
env |grep -i 'id'
EOF
```

### Native Protocols

The connect feature can be used to interact with native protocols such as databases, SSH, HTTP and TCP.
The port is forwarded locally to the end-user, providing a secure connection to remote services.

```bash
$ hoop connect pg-prod --port 5433
connection: pg-prod | session: 4619c80f-7166-487c-8c9f-9609e59ae5d6

--------------------postgres-credentials--------------------
      host=127.0.0.1 port=5433 user=noop password=noop
------------------------------------------------------------
ready to accept connections!
```

<Info>
  The connection is established through a secure tunnel by an encrypted channel when the gateway is setup with TLS.
  The user identity is always validated when interacting with such resources.
