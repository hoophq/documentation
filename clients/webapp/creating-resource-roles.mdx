Hoop.dev provides an intuitive web interface to create and manage secure connections to your resources. The resource role setup process is divided into three simple steps:

1. Resource Type Selection
2. Agent Configuration
3. Resource Role Credentials

## Resource Type Selection

When setting up a new resource, you'll first choose one of the multiple types of resources available. If you're not sure what type of resource you need, you can choose the Demo Postgres resource to get started.

## Agent Configuration
After selecting your resource type, you'll need to configure the agent that will be used to connect to the resource. You can choose to use the default agent or you can create a new agent.

The agent is the component that will be used to connect to the resource. It is responsible for:
- Authenticating to the resource
- Connecting to the resource
- Transmitting data to and from the resource

<Note>You can learn more about agents in the [Agents](/learn/concepts/agents) section.</Note>

## Resource Role Credentials

After selecting your resource type, you'll need to provide the necessary credentials and connection details. The required fields vary by resource type.

</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Configuration

After configuring the agent and the resource role credentials, you will be able to configure additional settings for your resource role on the configuration section.

- Add optional tags for organization
- Configure additional security features
    - Reviews - Require approval prior to resource role execution
    - AI Data Masking - Automatically mask sensitive data in query results
    - and more...
