Hoop.dev provides a comprehensive access management system that allows administrators to control who can access specific connections. This is primarily managed through user groups and connection-specific configurations.

## Managing Users and Groups

### User Management
From the sidebar, administrators can access the [Users](https://use.hoop.dev/organization/users) section to:
- View all members in the organization
- Create new users
- Manage user statuses
- Edit user details and group assignments

### Group Management
Groups are the primary way to organize users and control access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Groups">
    Administrators can create groups that represent teams, roles, or access levels (e.g., engineering, sales, admin)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign Users">
    Users can be assigned to one or multiple groups:
    - Click the **Edit** button next to a user
    - Add or remove groups from the user's profile
    - Save the changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Connection Access
