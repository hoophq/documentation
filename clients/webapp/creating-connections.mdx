Hoop.dev provides an intuitive web interface to create and manage secure connections to your resources. The connection setup process is divided into three simple steps:

1. Resource Selection
2. Credentials Configuration
3. Review and Create

## Resource Selection

When creating a new connection, you'll first choose from three main resource types:

  <Card title="Database" icon="database">
    For databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and more.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Linux VM, Container or Console" icon="terminal">
    For Linux servers, Docker, Kubernetes or other applications.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Network service access (ZTNA)" icon="network-wired">
    For internal network resources.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Credentials Configuration

</Frame>

After selecting your resource type, you'll need to provide the necessary credentials and connection details. The required fields vary by resource type:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database Connections">
    First, select your database type:
    - Microsoft SQL
    - MongoDB
    - MySQL
    - Oracle DB
    - PostgreSQL

    Then provide the following credentials:
    - Host address (e.g. localhost)
    - Port number (e.g. 3306)
    - Username
    - Password
    - Database name
    - SSL mode (Optional)
    - Agent selection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Linux VM, Container or Console">
    Choose your connection subtype:
    
    ### Linux VM or Container
    - Access and manage with terminal commands
    
    ### Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)
    - Private Key (paste your file content)
    - SSH URI (ssh://[uri])
    - Agent selection
    
    ### Console
    Select your application type:
    - Ruby on Rails
    - Python
    - Node.js
    - Clojure

    Additional settings:
    - Operating system (MacOS/Linux)
    - Environment variables (Key-Value pairs)
    - Configuration files
      - Name (e.g. kub_config)
      - Content
    - Additional command (optional)
    - Agent selection
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Network Service Access (ZTNA)">
    First, select your network access type:
    - TCP
    - HTTP (Coming Soon)

    Then provide:
    - Host address (e.g. localhost)
    - Port number
    - Agent selection
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Agents provide secure interaction with your connection. Learn more about [Agents](/learn/concepts/agent).

## Review and Create

</Frame>

In the final step, you'll:

1. Set a connection name
2. Add optional tags for organization
3. Configure additional security features:
    - Reviews - Require approval prior to connection execution
    - AI Data Masking - Automatically mask sensitive data in query results

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Meaningful Names" icon="tag">
    Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose and environment of the connection.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Tag Organization" icon="tags">
    Utilize tags to categorize and manage connections effectively.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Enable Reviews" icon="shield-check">
    Set up reviews for sensitive connections to maintain security.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data Protection" icon="mask">
    Enable AI Data Masking when handling sensitive information.
