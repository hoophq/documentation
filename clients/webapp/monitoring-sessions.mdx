The Sessions interface provides a comprehensive view of all connection activities across your organization. You can monitor active sessions, review past activities, and investigate specific actions taken by users.

## Sessions Overview

The Sessions page displays a list of all connection activities with key information:
- User who initiated the session
- Connection name and type
- Session ID for reference
- Timestamp and duration
- Status indicators

### Filtering and Search

Use the top filters to narrow down sessions:
- **User**: Filter by specific team members
- **Connection**: View sessions for particular connections
- **Type**: Filter by connection type (database, application, etc.)
- **Period**: Select a specific time range
