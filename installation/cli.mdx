## Authenticate

### For Managed Instance Users
If you're using our managed instance, you can skip directly to the [`hoop login`](#authentication) command below. The gateway URL will automatically be set to `https://use.hoop.dev`.

### For Self-Hosted Users
If you've deployed your own instance, use the URL you specified in the `API_URL` environment variable of your Hoop Gateway:

```bash
hoop config create --api-url https://<gateway-url>
```

The configuration will be saved to `$HOME/.hoop/config.yaml`.

### Obtaining an Access Token

Once the gateway URL is configured, authenticate with the API by running:

```bash
hoop login
```

This command will open your default browser and redirect you to the identity provider for authentication.

### Using Environment Variables

Another way to use the command line is by exporting the following environment variables:

```
export HOOP_APIURL=https://use.hoop.dev
export HOOP_GRPCURL=grpcs://use.hoop.dev:8443
export HOOP_TOKEN=<your-access-token-or-api-key>
# test it
hoop admin get userinfo
```

When using environment variables, it will ignore the local configuration file `$HOME/.hoop/config.yaml`

### Managing Configuration

To remove your existing configuration:

```bash
hoop config clear
```

This command will delete all stored configuration settings, including the gateway URL and authentication tokens.

## hoop connect


The `hoop connect` command allows you to create an interactive session with a remote resource. The resource can be an interactive terminal console or TCP services such as databases.. Here are a few examples:

### Terminal console

- docker exec
- bash
- ssh
- rails console
- python console
- kubectl exec
- aws ecs execute-command

```bash
hoop connect bash-console
connection: bash-console | session: 53ed53f9-a5f9-45e9-bbf5-becd1f44f41e
root@5601881aa15e:/app#
```

### TCP

The connect feature can be used to interact with TCP services such as databases. It can be used with an IDE or any native database client. The port is forwarded locally to the end-user, providing a secure connection to remote services.

```bash
$ hoop connect pg-prod
connection: pg-prod | session: 4619c80f-7166-487c-8c9f-9609e59ae5d6

--------------------postgres-credentials--------------------
      host=127.0.0.1 port=5433 user=noop password=noop
------------------------------------------------------------
ready to accept connections!
```

<Info>
The connection is established through a secure tunnel. The connection is encrypted and authenticated using the user's identity.
