## Navigation Structure Update
- Updated `mint.json` to reflect the new directory structure
- Reorganized navigation groups to match the new sections
- Updated all file paths in the navigation to point to the new locations

## Files Requiring Content
The following files are placeholders that need content to be created:

### Learn Section
1. `learn/webapp/overview.mdx`
2. `learn/webapp/creating-connections.mdx`
3. `learn/webapp/managing-access.mdx`
4. `learn/webapp/monitoring-sessions.mdx`
5. `learn/features/reviews/command-reviews.mdx`
6. `learn/features/guardrails.mdx`

### Concepts Section
1. `concepts/connection.mdx`
2. `concepts/security.mdx`
3. `concepts/network.mdx`
4. `concepts/deployment-options.mdx`

### Technical Reference Section
1. `technical-reference/architecture/components.mdx`
2. `technical-reference/architecture/security-model.mdx`
3. `technical-reference/architecture/network-flow.mdx`

## Duplicated Files
The following files have been duplicated in multiple locations:

1. `learn/architecture.mdx` â†’ duplicated to:
   - `concepts/how-it-works.mdx`
   - `technical-reference/architecture/overview.mdx`

2. `learn/api-key-usage.mdx` â†’ duplicated to:
   - `learn/features/api-key-usage.mdx`
   - `technical-reference/apis/api-key-usage.mdx`

3. `learn/webhooks-siem.mdx` â†’ duplicated to:
   - `learn/features/webhooks-siem.mdx`
   - `technical-reference/apis/webhooks-siem.mdx`

## Next Steps
1. Review all internal links in the documentation files to ensure they point to the correct new locations
2. Fill in placeholder files with appropriate content
3. Test the documentation site to ensure all links work correctly
4. Consider adding redirects from old URLs to new URLs to maintain backward compatibility
5. Decide whether to keep duplicated content or create specialized versions for each section

## Note
This restructuring preserves all existing content while reorganizing it into a more logical structure. Some files have been duplicated in multiple locations where the content is relevant to multiple sections. All placeholder files need to be populated with appropriate content.

## Temporary Files (to be removed before merging)
- `FILE_STATUS.md`
- `mark_files.sh`
- `restructuring-summary.md`
