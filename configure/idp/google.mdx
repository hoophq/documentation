## Configuring Groups

Groups are synchronized by performing a request to the Gsuite Directory API as a best effort operation.

<Note>
  The name of groups is synchronized as e-mail addresses
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Scope">
    Configure the gateway with the env **IDP_CUSTOM_SCOPES**

    - `IDP_CUSTOM_SCOPES=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`

    *Restart the gateway after applying these changes*.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the Admin SDK API">

    - Visit the [Admin SDK API Page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/admin.googleapis.com/overview)
    - Clik in the button `ENABLE`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  When you configure groups to sync, you'll lose the admin access on the next sign in.
  To prevent this issue, set the configuration `ADMIN_USERNAME` to a group that you consider as admin on Gsuite.
</Warning>
