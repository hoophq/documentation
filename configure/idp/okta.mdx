    - The Issuer URI depends on the authorization server being used. Refer to [this documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#available-authorization-server-types).
    <Info>
    If Okta does not allow external applications to validate access tokens, add the query string option `_userinfo=1` when configuring the Gateway. It indicates to use the user info endpoint.
    The _userinfo value is removed when used to exchange information with the identity provider.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Groups Claims">
  - Go to `Security > API > {authorization server} > Claims`
  - Add `https://app.hoop.dev/groups` in the ID Token
  <Info>
  If the above instructions are not applicable to your Okta setup, configure it by adding a group claim to the organization's authorization server. Refer to [this documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/customize-tokens-groups-claim/main/#add-a-groups-claim-for-the-org-authorization-server).
