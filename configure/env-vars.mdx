    ### **Using `IDP_URI`**

    <Note>
      This configuration takes precedence over `IDP_ISSUER`, `IDP_CLIENT_ID`, `IDP_CLIENT_SECRET` and `IDP_CUSTOM_SCOPES`.
    </Note>

    | Environment  | Description   |
    | ------------ | ------------- |
    | IDP_URI      | OIDC & Oauth2 configuration in URI format: `<scheme>://<client-id>:<client-secret>@<issuer-host>?<options>` |

    The `<options>` could be used for further configuration by passing them as query strings.

    | Option     | Description |
    | --------------- |-------------
    | scopes | Additional Oauth2 scopes to append in the request. Default values are `openid`, `profile` and `email`. |
    | groupsclaim | The name of the claim to consider as configuration to propagate groups. Default to `https://app.hoop.dev/groups` |
