Hoop includes the Open Source license by default. If you're evaluating or using enterprise features,
this guide will help you manage your license in your current installation.

## License Characteristics

- A single license can be applied to multiple hosts
- All licenses have an expiration date
- The gateway stops functioning when your license expires

## Managing Licenses Through the Web Application

The web application allows you to upload a new license or update an expired one.

<Info>
    The web application only permits license updates after expiration.
    To update an active license before it expires, use the command line utility instead.
</Info>

## Managing Licenses Through the Command Line

The command line interface provides more flexibility, including the ability to update licenses before expiration:

```sh
hoop admin license install --file /path/to/license.json
```

### License Information

To obtain license information of you current installation

```sh
hoop admin serverinfo

(...)
License:
  Key ID:        743420a...79bc

## Handling Expired Licenses

When a license expires, all execution attempts will fail with an error. You have two options:

1. Update to a new enterprise license
2. Downgrade to the Open Source license

<Tip>
    Contact [our support team](https://help.hoop.dev) if your license is nearing expiration.
</Tip>

###  Downgrading to Open Source

To downgrade your installation, update the license with the Open Source version:

```
curl -L https://releases.hoop.dev/default-oss-license.json > /tmp/hoop-oss-license.json
hoop admin license install --file /tmp/hoop-oss-license.json
```

<Note>
    Advanced users can also remove license information by clearing the `license_data` column in the `private.orgs` database table.
