Hoop.dev's Jira integration transforms infrastructure access requests into automated Jira workflows, streamlining change management and security processes for your organization.

## Key Features

### Automated Change Management
- Automatically create and track Jira tickets for every infrastructure access request
- Maintain compliance with audit-ready change management records
- Reduce manual documentation and administrative overhead

### Seamless Workflow Integration
- Link access requests directly to Jira projects and request types
- Append contextual information from Hoop.dev sessions to Jira issues
- Support for custom and preset field mappings

### Flexible User Prompts & Data Collection
- Request additional information from users during access workflows
- Map manual or automated data to Jira fields for richer tickets

### CMDB & Asset Management Support
- Relate access requests to Configuration Management Database (CMDB) objects
- Automate asset linking and enforce asset-based workflows (requires Jira Assets)

## Benefits

- **Compliance:** Ensure every access request is tracked and auditable
- **Efficiency:** Eliminate manual ticket creation and reduce operational friction
- **Security:** Keep security and development teams in sync with real-time updates
- **Visibility:** Gain a complete audit trail of access and change events

## Integration with Other Features

Jira integration works seamlessly with other Hoop.dev features:
- **Guardrails:** Enforce policy and track exceptions via Jira
- **Session Recording:** Link session logs to Jira tickets for full traceability
- **Access Control:** Automate approvals and reviews through Jira workflows

## Configuration

To get started, enable the Jira integration in the Integrations section of your Hoop.dev instance.

    </Frame>
    To create a Jira Template, fill out the following information:
    - **Integration details:** Name, Description, Project Key, and Request Type.
    <Info>For more information about how to get Jira information check [Jira Templates](#jira-templates).</Info>
    - **Automated Mapping:** Append additional information to created Jira tickets when executing commands in a connection.
    <Info>For more information about available hoop.dev fields, check [Automated Mapping](#automated-mapping).</Info>
    - **Manual Prompt:** Request additional information from users when executing commands to be appended to created Jira tickets.
    <Info>For more information, check [Manual Prompt](#manual-prompt).</Info>

    </Frame>
    While creating or configuring a connection, navigate to <code>Advanced Settings</code> and select a Jira Template.
