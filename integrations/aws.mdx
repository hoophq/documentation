description: "Database Resource Discovery and Automatic Connection Creation."
---

This feature enables you to discover and provision common database roles to your RDS databases in AWS seamlessly.
Using either IAM credentials or the instance role of the Hoop Gateway, you can quickly grant database access to users.

## Requirements

- Access to AWS account with privileges to setup roles and/or IAM credentials
- You must be your account administrator to perform the following commands

## Configuration

Your IAM credentials must have the proper permission to use this feature.
Depending on which credentials you want to use, the role or the access key credentials must have the following permissions:

- **Policy Name:** HoopAWSConnect

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "organizations:ListAccounts",
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:ModifyDBInstance",
                "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy",
                "sts:AssumeRole"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

This requirement should be sufficient to begin the provisioning process in your main account.

### Multi Account Setup

For multi-account setup, you can configure your IAM user to access resources across different accounts:

- Create the role `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` with the permissions below for each AWS account that you want to allow Hoop to access:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:ModifyDBInstance"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

<Note>
    The name of the role is hard-coded at the moment. In upcoming releases, we will allow users to provide a custom role name.
</Note>

### Access Key Credentials

To use static credentials:
1. Go to the AWS Console > IAM
2. Create a user and configure an Access Key in Security Credentials

</Frame>

### Instance Role

To use the same instance role in which the gateway is running:
1. Set the environment variable `INTEGRATION_AWS_INSTANCE_ROLE_ALLOW=true`
2. When configuring the IAM credentials, set the region only before moving to the next page

## Agent Deployment

The agent connects to your underlying infrastructure to provision and access your databases.
Before proceeding, make sure to provision an agent for every private network in which your database is running.

<Note>
    If you have connectivity with all databases from a single machine, you could deploy the agent in this network
    to gain access to all databases using a single agent.
</Note>

## Supported Engines

- Postgres / Aurora
- MySQL / Aurora
- SQL Server

## Roles and Connection Management

The provisioner will reset the master database credentials using a random password.
The user and password are stored in Hoop's database. Subsequent requests for provisioning roles reuse the master credentials stored in Hoop.

<Note>
    In upcoming releases, our goal is to support more methods of using master credentials to access
    these instances, such as RDS Secrets Manager and IAM database authentication.
</Note>

The provisioner will create three static user roles for all existing databases depending on the engine:

- hoop_ro
- hoop_rw
- hoop_ddl

If you run the process multiple times, some database users might be removed and recreated.
The default behavior is to provision the role if it doesn't exist and change the password if the role already exists.

In the final step of the provisioning process, it creates connections with the credentials of each role.
Three connections are provisioned as the outcome:

- `<connection-name-prefix>-ro`
- `<connection-name-prefix>-rw`
- `<connection-name-prefix>-ddl`

The database user roles permissions are static and described below:

| ENGINE   | READ ONLY | READ WRITE | DDL       |
| -------- | ----------| ---------- | --------- |
| Postgres | `SELECT`    | `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` | `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER` |
| MySQL | `SELECT`    | `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` | `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, CREATE, DROP` |
| SQL Server | `db_datareader`    | `db_datareader, db_datawriter` | `db_datareader, db_datawriter, db_ddladmin` |
