## Pre-requisites

 - Self-host your Hoop Gateway. Our managed instance does not support this feature.
 - Have an API Key configured in your environment variables in the following format: `<org-id>|<random-string>`

## Setup

- The `org-id` is a value that you obtain in the user info endpoint. Use the command line to obtain this information, e.g.: `hoop admin get userinfo -o json`
- The `<random-string>` is a secure key string that is going to be used to authenticated your requests

<Warning>
    Make sure to use a tool with enough entropy to generate the `<random-string>` value.
    We recommend using `openssl` which is present in most unix systems by default. e.g.: `openssl rand 64 | base64`
</Warning>

## How it works

When requesting one of the allowed endpoints, you can pass the API Key in the `Api-Key` header with the configured value.
The Gateway will validate the API Key and allow the request to proceed without the need for user authentication.

## Permissions

The API Key has admin access in the system, make sure to keep the key secure.
