## Identity Provider Configuration

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create an Application">
    Login with your account at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
    - Go to `Credentials` > `Create Credentials` button > `OAuth Client ID`
    - In Application type, select `Web Application`
    - Give it a name (i.e. “Hoop”)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Redirect URIs">
    - Click Authorized redirect URIs and add the URL: `{API_URL}/api/callback`
    - Click Create button
    - Take note on the `ClientID` and `Client Secret`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect the Credentials">
    When you created the app, you got those. But they are also available in the JSON file that was downloaded by the creation time. The download is also available at:

    - Credentials > OAuth 2.0 Client IDs > Actions > Download
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Issuer Information">
  The Issuer URI is `https://accounts.google.com`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Groups

Groups are synchronized by performing a request to the [Cloud Identity API](https://cloud.google.com/identity/docs/reference/rest/v1/groups.memberships/searchDirectGroups) as a best effort operation.

<Note>
  This feature is available in version 1.35.2 and later.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the Scope">
    Configure the gateway with the env **IDP_CUSTOM_SCOPES**

    - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups.readonly`

    Users will need to provide consent for the following access permissions when first logging in to enable proper group synchronization.

    <Note>
      Restart the gateway after applying these changes.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the Cloud Identity API in your project">

    - Visit the [Cloud Identity API Page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/cloudidentity.googleapis.com/overview)
    - Clik in the button `ENABLE`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  When configuring group synchronization, admin access may be revoked upon your next sign-in.
  To maintain administrative privileges, set the `ADMIN_USERNAME` configuration parameter to a Google Workspace group that you want to map as admin on Hoop.
</Warning>
