## Requirements

- An [account in OKTA](https://developer.okta.com)
- `API_URL` is the public DNS name of the hoop gateway instance

Contact the administrator of the hoop gateway instance to retrieve the `API_URL` address.

## Identity Provider Configuration

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Create an Application">
    - Go to `Applications > Applications` and click on the Create App Integration button
    - In Sign-in Method, select OIDC - OpenID Connect
    - In Application type, select Web Application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the Redirect URIs">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect the Credentials">
    - In the Application Home copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
    <img src="/images/idp/okta-2.jpeg" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Issuer Information">
    - The Issuer URI depends on the authorization server being used. Refer to [this documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#available-authorization-server-types).
    <Info>
    If Okta does not allow external applications to validate access tokens, add the query string option `_userinfo=1` when configuring the Gateway. It indicates to use the user info endpoint.
    The _userinfo value is removed when used to exchange information with the identity provider.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Groups

Explains how to configure groups claim to propagate when users sign in.

<Info>
  Refer to [Okta's Documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/customize-tokens-groups-claim/main/#add-a-groups-claim-for-the-org-authorization-server) for more information.
</Info>

<Steps titleSize="h3">
  <Step title="Add Groups Claims">
    - Go to `Security > API > {authorization server} > Claims`
    - Click on `Add Claims` button

    Add the `groups` claim for the ID Token to any scope (image below)

    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Token Preview Test">
    This step validate if the configuration is returning the `groups` claim properly

    - Go to `Token Preview` tab
    - Select the Hoop Application
    - Select the Grant Type as `Authorization Code`
    - Select a user associated with this application
    - Add the scope `openid`

    The payload must appear with a claim named `groups` containing the groups associated with your application (image below)

    </Frame>

    <Warning>
      Please note that the `groups` claim **will not be present when a user has no group assignments**.
      Hoop synchronizes group information only when this attribute is configured.
      To prevent potential issues, ensure each user is assigned to at least one default group.
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Hoop Gateway">
    The Hoop gateway requires proper configuration to correctly map claim names for synchronization.
    For detailed instructions, please consult the [OAuth2/OIDC Authentication Documentation](/setup/configuration/env-vars)
  </Step>
