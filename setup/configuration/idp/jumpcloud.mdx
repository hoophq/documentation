<Info>
  JumpCloud doesnâ€™t emit JWT as access token, thus the gateway validates if a client is authenticated performing an http request to the userinfo endpoint (oidc spec).
</Info>

## Requirements

  - An [admin account in JumpCloud](https://console.jumpcloud.com)
  - `API_URL` is the public DNS name of the hoop gateway instance

Contact the administrator of the hoop gateway instance to retrieve the `API_URL` address.
