## AWS RDS IAM Authentication

You can authenticate to your DB cluster using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication. IAM database authentication works with PostgreSQL.
With this authentication method, you don't need to use a password when you connect to a DB. Instead, you use an authentication token.


## Configuration


<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure AWS RDS IAM Authentication in your AWS">
     - Follow the steps in the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html) to enable IAM authentication for your RDS instance.
     - Make sure your AWS has the policy for [IAM database access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.IAMPolicy.html)
     For example, the policy below allows the user db-user to connect to the database cluster-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234 using IAM authentication.
     
```json
{
    "Version":"2012-10-17",		 	 	 
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds-db:connect"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-2:111122223333:dbuser:cluster-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234/db_user"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

     <Info>
     If you want more users, you need to add a Resource for each user in the policy. `arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-2:111122223333:dbuser:cluster-ABCDEFGHIJKL01234/db_user2`
     </Info>

     - [Creating a database account using IAM authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.html#UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.DBAccounts.PostgreSQL).
     ```sql
CREATE USER db_user; 
GRANT rds_iam TO db_user;
     ```
     <Info>
     You need to grant the role `rds_iam` to the user to be able to connect using IAM authentication.
     You also need to grant permissions if the db_user needs to read and write to databases and schemas.
     For example, `GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO db_user;` - this will be the permission you will have when connecting via Hoop.
     </Info>

    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure the AWS Auth on Hoop">
      <p >
        When creating a new role, the User and Pass information must follow the following format:
        - User: `_aws_iam_rds:db_user`
        - Pass: `_aws_iam_rds:authtoken`

        Role information can be mapped using the following syntax:

        <Frame>
          <img
            src="/images/learn/rdsiamauth.png"
          />
        </Frame>

        <Info>
        When connecting to the database, Hoop will generate the auth token for you.
        </Info>

      </p>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing">
  <p>
    - You can run the query on webapp.
    - You can run `hoop connect <rolename>` and use your preferred SQL client to connect to the database.
    - You can create a native connection on the webapp.
  </p>

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
 Make sure your agent has the AWS credentials configured or can assume an AWS role that can use the policy created previously 
 to be able to generate the auth token.
