title: "Runbooks"
---

This page explains the available options to configure Runbooks with your git server.

<Note>
  This guide provides step-by-step instructions for configuring Runbooks using the command line. Currently, the Webapp supports configuration exclusively with SSH private keys with limited options.
</Note>

To start, make sure to install the hoop command line and login to your gateway instance:

```sh
hoop config create --api-url https://<API_URL>
hoop login
```

## Public Repositories

To configure any public repositories

```sh
hoop admin create plugin runbooks --overwrite \
	-c GIT_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
```

**Required Configuration:**

- `GIT_URL` (required) - the GIT URL of the repository (http or ssh)

## Basic Credentials

It uses username and password to clone a repository via HTTP.

```sh
hoop admin create plugin runbooks --overwrite \
	-c GIT_URL=https://github.com/your-org/your-repo \
	-c GIT_PASSWORD=your-personal-access-token
```

**Required Configuration:**

- `GIT_URL` (required) - the HTTP GIT URL of the repository
- `GIT_USER` (optional) - the git username, defaults to `oauth2` if it’s empty
- `GIT_PASSWORD` (required) - the password or token that has read access to the repository

<Tip>
  GitHub users could use [personal tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens)
</Tip>

## SSH Private Keys

It uses a private key to clone the repository via SSH.

```sh
hoop admin create plugin runbooks --overwrite \
    -c GIT_URL=git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git \
    -c GIT_SSH_KEY=file://$HOME/.ssh/your_key
```

<Tip>
  GitHub users could follow the [Setup Deploy Keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys#set-up-deploy-keys) guide to generate a key.
</Tip>

**Required Configuration:**

- `GIT_URL` (required) - the HTTP GIT URL of the repository
- `GIT_SSH_KEY` (required) - the private key that has read access to the repository
- `GIT_SSH_USER` (optional) - the git username, defaults to `git` if it’s empty
- `GIT_SSH_KEYPASS` (optional) - the password of the key
- `GIT_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` (optional) - the path to the known hosts file to use

<Info>
  We recommend using the option `GIT_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` to prevent [MITM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) when cloning repositories. It will try to obtain the known hosts issuing the command `ssh-keyscan` in case this configuration is not set.
</Info>

## Testing

To test the integration, issue the command below, it will return the last commit from the directory. When you add a **runbook** file it will show in the **items** attribute.

```sh
hoop admin get runbooks -o json
{"items":[],"commit":"<git-sha>","commit_author":"author <author@email.tld>","commit_message":"<msg>\n"}
```

## Runbook Hooks

<Note>
  This feature is available in version 1.36.11+.
</Note>

This functionality enables easier integration with any internal workflow by leveraging Hoop as a hook system for your process. It requires specific files in the repository that will start the execution of a runbook when a specific event occurs.

| File Path                             | Event Trigger | Environment Variables       | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hoop-hooks/session-open.runbook.py`  | Session Open  | `HOOP_RUNBOOK_HOOK_PAYLOAD` | It triggers when a session is being opened. It may be triggered more than once in case the connection has the review enabled. |
| `hoop-hooks/session-close.runbook.py` | Session Close | `HOOP_RUNBOOK_HOOK_PAYLOAD` | It triggers when a session is being closed.                                                                                   |

The environment variables are available when the runbook script is called, it contains the payload of the event that triggered the runbook.

### Configuring

This feature is currently available only through the command line when a specific plugin configuration is enabled. Web application support will be added in an upcoming release.

To enable this feature, configure the cache time expiration using the `GIT_HOOK_CONFIG_TTL` parameter. This parameter serves two purposes: it activates the runbook hooks functionality and sets the time-to-live (in seconds) for the configuration cache.

```sh
hoop admin create plugin runbooks --overwrite \
    -c GIT_URL=git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git \
    -c GIT_SSH_KEY=file://$HOME/.ssh/your_key \
    -c GIT_HOOK_CONFIG_TTL=120
```

<Tip>
  Use a high value in case you don't change the runbooks often, this will reduce the number of requests to the git server.
</Tip>

### JSON Payload

- The attribute `event_session_open` will be available when the session is opened
- The attribute `event_session_close` will be available when the session is closed

```json
{
  "id": "7b769f42-a8a2-45cb-b0a1-e2d039385365",
  "sid": "8c59a347-62bd-4db2-a456-2b25963dfebf",
  "command": ["python3"],
  "event_session_open": {
    "verb": "connect",
    "connection_name": "pg-readonly",
    "connection_type": "database",
    "connection_subtype": "postgres",
    "connection_envs": {
      "PWD": "/",
      "HOME": "/root"
    },
    "connection_reviewers": [],
    "input": "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = 1",
    "user_email": "user@domain.tld"
  },
  "event_session_close": {
    "exit_code": 0,
    "output": ""
  }
}
```

### Example Python Script

The example below shows how to use the payload in a python script, it will print the connection name and the session id.

```python
# hoop-hooks/session-open.runbook.py
import json, os

payload_json = os.getenv('HOOP_RUNBOOK_HOOK_PAYLOAD')
req = json.loads(payload_json)

print('id: ', req['id'])
print('session id: ', req['sid'])

ev = req['event_session_open'] or {}
print('connection_name: {}'.format(ev['connection_name']))
```

## How the template engine works

Runbooks use the [GO text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) as the template engine. A runbook is a template to be run against a connection, the placeholders are rendered by inputs provided by an HTTP client.

To define an input, the runbook must be enclosed with `{{ }}` and the input name must start with a dot. - Example - `{{ .myinput }}`

The input name must comply with the regular expression `\.[a-zA-Z0-9_]+`

### Template Specification

A client could implement input validation based on how templates are created, the specification of inputs are derived from a runbook. The template below:

```sql
SELECT name FROM customers WHERE id = '{{ .customer_id }}'
```

Generates the following specification:

- `GET /api/plugins/runbooks/connections/:dbconn/templates `

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "name": "team/finops/sql/fetch-customer.runbook.sql",
            "metadata": {
                "customer_id": {
                    "description": "",
                    "required": false,
                    "type": "text"
                }
            }
        }
    ],
    "commit": "b96851b9cf7065f9af0977e506cd1970c60cc87c",
    "commit_author": "Author <author@domain.tld>",
    "commit_message": "<commit-message>"
}
```

#### Supported Fields

The specifications supports the following fields:

- description - the description of the input
- type - the type of the input
  - text
  - number
  - tel
  - time
  - date
  - url
  - email
  - select
  - file
- required - if the this field is required
- default - specifies a default value for an input if it’s empty

The fields indicates how a client could create inputs to a runbook, the fields are defined as function templates in an placeholder using the pipe character `|`. Example:

```
{{ .customer_id
  | description "the id of the customer"
  | required "customer_id is required"
  | type "number" }}
```

### Ordering Fields 

In some runbooks, you may want input fields to appear in a specific order for example:

- showing required fields first
- grouping related parameters together
- improving the overall user experience when launching a runbook

To define the order in which fields appear in the Web App, you can add the `order` attribute as shown in the example below.

```
{{ .client_id
| description "Client ID"
  | required "client_id is required"
  | order 1
}}
{{ .client_secret
| description "Client Secret"
  | required "Client secret is required"
  | order 2
}}
```

#### **Expected behavior**

- Lower values appear first (e.g., order 1 comes before order 2).
- Fields without an order value will fall back to the default UI ordering.
- If you don’t set an order for a field, it will automatically be placed lower in the list.

> **Coming soon:** Field reordering will be available directly in the Hoop Web App UI as a built-in feature.

### Template Functions

The template engine has auxiliary functions which helps to build better and secure templates:

- `required "<message>"` - it will return the error if the input is empty
  - `<message>` - the message to return when the condition doesn’t match
- `default "<value>"` - add a default value to the input if it’s empty
  - `<value>` - the default value to set
- `pattern "<regexp>"` - a regexp pattern to validate the input
  - `<regexp>` - the go regular expression to validate the input
- `description "<message>"` - used as attribute specification to client input validation
  - `<message>` - the description of the input
- `type "<type>"` - used as attribute specification to client input validation
  - `<type>` - the type of the input (see supported fields for a list of types)
- `placeholder "<message>"` - used as attribute specification to client input validation
  - `<message>` - the description of the placeholder
- `options "<option>" "..."` - used as attribute specification to client input validation
  - `"<option>" "..."` - a list of strings describing each option
- `squote` - wraps the input with single quotes: `'`
- `dquote` - wraps the input with double quotes: `"`
- `quotechar "<char>"` - wraps the input with `<char>`
  - `<char>` - the character to wrap the input
- `encodeb64` - encode the input as base64
- `decodeb64` - decode a base64 input
- `asenv "<environment>"` - add the input as a environment variable
  - `<environment>` - the name of the environment variable

> The functions description and type always returns the value of the last command.

#### Usage

Template functions may be “chained” by separating a sequence of commands with pipeline characters ‘|’. In a chained pipeline, the result of each command is passed as the last argument of the following command. The output of the final command in the pipeline is the value of the pipeline.

The output of a command will be either one value or two values, the second of which has type error. If that second value is present and evaluates to non-nil, the runbook will fail to execute describing what went wrong.

Examples:

- Encode the `myinput` as base64

```
myvar = {{ .myinput
            | encodeb64 }}
```

- Wrap the `myinput` into single quote and encode the input as base64

```
myvar = {{ .myinput
            | squote
            | encodeb64 }}
```

- Gives a description to `myinput`, encode the value as base64 and then wrap it using the character `%`

```
myvar = {{ .myinput
            | description "this is my input"
            | quotechar "%" }}
```

- Specify the `color` as input type select with options red, white and black

```
myvar = {{ .color
          | type "select"
          | options "red" "white" "black"}}
```

#### asenv function

The `asenv` function allows defining inputs and mapping then as environment variables in the connection runtime. Instead of injecting the value as an input directly to the template, it will gather the value and inject as an environment variable when executing the session.

The inputs could be just defined in a comment in the template, examples:

- Python Connection Runtime

```python
# {{ .customer_id | asenv "CUSTOMER_ID" }}
# {{ .country | asenv "COUNTRY_CODE" }}
import os
print os.environ['CUSTOMER_ID']
print os.environ['COUNTRY_CODE']
```

- Bash Connection Runtime

```shell
# {{ .deployment | asenv "DEPLOYMENT_NAME" }}
# {{ .namespace | asenv "NAMESPACE" }}
kubectl rollout restart deploy/$DEPLOYMENT_NAME -n $NAMESPACE
```

### Linter

The command line provides a linter to validate the runbook templates before executing them. It will check if the inputs are valid and if the template is well formed.

- **Validating a file**

```sh
hoop runbooks lint /path/to/my/query.runbook.sql
```

- Validating content from stdin

```sh
cat /path/to/my/query.runbook.sql | hoop runbooks lint
hoop runbooks lint <<< '{{ .status | description "The status of the resource" | default "online" }}'
hoop runbooks lint <<EOF
{{ .status | description "The status of the resource" | default "online" }}
EOF
```

- **Validating parameters**

```sh
hoop runbooks lint -p customer_id=123 -p country=US <<EOF
{{ .customer_id | description "Customer ID" | required "customer_id is required" }}
{{ .country | description "Country" | required "country is required" }}
{{ .status | description "The status of the resource" | default "online" }}
EOF
```

- **Error Handling**

If there are any errors, it will be reported to the standard error stream (stderr) and the command will return a non-zero exit code.

```sh
cat - > /tmp/invalid-runbook.runbook.py <<EOF
{{ .customer_id
    | description "Customer ID"
    | required "customer_id is required" }}

{{ .country
    | description "Country"
    | require "country is required" }}

{{ .status
    | description "The status of the resource"
    | default "online" }}

EOF
```

```sh
hoop runbooks lint /tmp/invalid-runbook.runbook.py
failed parsing runbook template, reason=(...) function "require" not defined

{{ .country
    | description "Country"
    | require "country is required" }}

{{ .status
    | description "The status of the resource"
```

### Tips

#### Server Side Template Injection

Templates are subject to [code injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection) depending on the runtime that you’re using. To mitigate this issue, follows these tips:

- Use the pattern function to define the format of the input, specially in sql templates.

```sql
SELECT name FROM customers WHERE id = '{{ .customer_id | pattern "^[0-9]+$" }}'
```

This pattern guarantees that the input will be only a number, this prevents any user to inject any sql instruction

- Use the asenv function to expose inputs as environment variables if your runtime supports it
- This will map the `customer_id` input as an environment variable avoiding bash injections with shell control operators

```shell
# {{ .customer_id | asenv "CUSTOMER_ID" }}
/path/to/my/script.sh "$CUSTOMER_ID"
```

- The same applies to language runtimes.

```python
# {{ .customer_id | asenv "CUSTOMER_ID" }}
import os
if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(os.environ['CUSTOMER_ID'])
```
