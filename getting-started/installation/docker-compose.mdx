## Download & Launch

<Steps>
  <Step title="Obtain the VM Public DNS or IP">
    - Get the IP address or the public DNS of your virtual machine.
    - Open inbound traffic to ports **TCP/80** and **TCP/443**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the .env file">
    Configure the environment variable with the **public DNS** from your VM.

    ```sh
    cat - > .env <<EOF
    HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=<vm-public-dns>
    EOF
    ```

    <Note>
      If you’re running the setup without a reachable DNS, specify the IP address with the suffix `.nip.io`. This service allows mapping any IP address to a valid DNS. For example, if your IP address is **200.15.20.5** then you be able to use the domain `200.15.20.5.nip.io`.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the compose file">
    Copy the `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-tls.yml` file into your local file system.

    ```sh
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoophq/hoop/main/deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml > ./docker-compose.yml
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoophq/hoop/main/deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose-tls.yml > ./docker-compose-tls.yml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run">
    <Warning>
      We highly recommend using **TLS** if this is proof of concept to connect your local infra-structure services.
    </Warning>

    - TLS Disabled

    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```

    - TLS Enabled

    ```sh
    echo HOOP_TLS_MODE=enabled >> .env
    ```

    ```sh
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-tls.yml up
    ```

    <Note>
      The deployed services will be available on ports **80** and **443**.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

A success launch will return the logs of the gateway and the agent

```log
hoop-gateway-1  | (...) starting servers
hoop-gateway-1  | (...) starting gateway at 0.0.0.0:8010
hoop-gateway-1  | (...) server transport created, tls=false
(...)
hoop-agent-1    | (...) connected with success to <$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME>
```

## Inviting your coworkers to use Hoop

<Note>
As default, we use [Zitadel](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel) as the identity provider for Hoop. If you want to change it, go to the [customization section](#customization) in this page to see how to do it.
</Note>

This section explains how to onboarding new users on Zitadel administrative UI.

<Note>
The login used to authenticate to Hoop is also an admin on Zitadel.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Zitadel admin panel">
    Go to `http://$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME/ui/console`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to hoophq settings">
    Go to **Default Settings** (top right button) and click on `hoophq` organization.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/getting-started/installation/zitadel-panel-default-settings.png"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a new user">
    Click on **Users** (top menu) > **New** and fill the form to create a new user
    <Tip>
      Make sure to check the option: **Set Initial Password**. This option does not depend on sending an email which is unavailable for this setup.
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the credentials with your colleague">
    Share the user's login and password with your colleague. They can now authenticate in the Hoop Instance using these credentials in the same process as you did first to authenticate
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customization

### Custom Identity Provider

<Tip>
Refer to the [SSO documentation](/configure/idp/get-started) for instructions on how to obtain these values from your identity provider.
</Tip>

1. Remove any previous installation

```sh
docker compose down -v
```

2. Configure the `.env` file

<Note>
We recommend setting the gateway with TLS because most identity providers does not allow specifying the redirect URL without a secure scheme (https).
</Note>

```sh
# configure .env file
cat - > .env <<EOF
HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=<vm-public-dns>
HOOP_TLS_MODE=enabled
IDP_ISSUER=
IDP_CLIENT_ID=
IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
IDP_AUDIENCE=
EOF
```

3. Run it

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-tls.yml up
```

### TLS

This setup supports TLS with self signed certificates. It will generate them by default on the volume mapped to `/hoopdata/tls`.

- `/hoopdata/tls/ca.crt`: the certificate authority (Root CA)
- `/hoopdata/tls/server.crt`: the server certificate
- `/hoopdata/tls/server.key`: the server private key

To obtain the self signed certificate authority file from an installation, issue the command below:

```sh
docker exec hoop-nginx-1 cat /hoopdata/tls/ca.crt
```

**To configure the setup with your own certificates:**

```sh
CERT_PATH=/tmp/tls
cat - > .env <<EOF
HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=<vm-public-dns>
HOOP_TLS_MODE=enabled
NGINX_TLS_CA=$(cat $CERT_PATH/ca.crt |base64)
NGINX_TLS_KEY=$(cat $CERT_PATH/server.key |base64)
NGINX_TLS_CERT=$(cat $CERT_PATH/server.cert |base64)
EOF
```

#### Let's Encrypt (optional)

This section explains how to issue a valid certificate for your Hoop instance with [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

<Info>
 This guide requires a valid domain and access to manage it's own DNS.
</Info>

1. Export the environment variable with your domain name

```sh
export HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=<vm-public-domain>
```

2. - Execute the command below to issue a new certificate

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/tls
docker run -v /tmp/tls/:/etc/letsencrypt/archive/ \
    --rm -it certbot/certbot \
    -d "*.$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME" \
    --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly \
    --agree-tos \
    --register-unsafely-without-email
```

3. Add the **TXT** record in your DNS management system

4. Encode the certificates as base64 and set it to the `.env` file

```sh
CERT_PATH=/tmp/tls
cat - > .env <<EOF
HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME=$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME
NGINX_TLS_CA=$(cat $CERT_PATH/$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME/fullchain1.pem |base64)
NGINX_TLS_KEY=$(cat $CERT_PATH/$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME/cert1.pem |base64)
NGINX_TLS_CERT=$(cat $CERT_PATH/$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME/privkey1.pem |base64)
EOF
```

**DNS Configuration**

For the setup to work, make sure to publish `$HOOP_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME` with the public DNS of your machine.

## Clean Up

Stop and remove all containers and volumes

```sh
docker compose stop
docker compose down -v
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="HSTS self signed certificates">
    If you are using a subdomain, your browser may restrict access due to an HSTS policy in your root domain. Try to use another domain or install the certificate authority (ca.crt) in your local system.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Terraform State Issues">
    We use Terraform to bootstrap the configuration with Zitadel; some issues may arise due to the state being inconsistent or not being cleaned properly. The command below will wipe all volumes, including the terraform state folder:
    ```sh
    docker compose down -v
    ```
  </Accordion>
