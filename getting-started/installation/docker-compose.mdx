## One-line install

This script will do the same steps as the manual installation, but in an automated way.

```sh
curl -sL https://hoop.dev/install.sh | sh
```

If you want to do it manually or with a custom identity provider, follow the **Manual Installation** guide below.

## Manual Installation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the Docker Compose file">
    ```sh
    curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoophq/hoop/main/deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose.yml > ./docker-compose.yml
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set the .env file">
    This step is required for authentication mostly, but a lot more configurations can be added to your .env file.
    Check all the available configurations in the [environment variables section](/configure/env-vars).

    Going with basic JWT Authentication is recommended because it's the fastest way to get started.

    <Tabs>
        <Tab title="JWT authentication">
            This will generate a secret key for you and set it in the .env file already.
            ```sh
            echo "JWT_SECRET_KEY=$(LC_ALL=C tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ < /dev/urandom | head -c 43 | xargs)" >> .env
            ```

            Alternatively, you can generate your own secret key and set it in the .env file. Here's an example using openssl CLI

            ```sh
            openssl rand 128 | base64
            ```

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Custom Identity Provider">
        Setting up your Identity Provider is a bit more complex, but it's a one-time setup. If you don't have admin access to your Identity Provider, you can use the default one provided by Hoop, which will make your life much easier to get to know hoop.dev.

        Below you can see an example of how to set up the .env file with the Identity Provider values. See our [Identity Providers section](/configure/idp/get-started) for more information on how to obtain these values.

          ```sh
          cat - > .env <<EOF
          IDP_ISSUER=
          IDP_CLIENT_ID=
          IDP_CLIENT_SECRET=
          IDP_AUDIENCE=
          EOF
          ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run">
    This process might take a few minutes to download the images and start the containers.
    ```sh
    docker compose up
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage the containers">
    To view the container logs:
    ```sh
    docker compose logs -f
    ```
    To stop the containers:
    ```sh
    docker compose down
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access the developer portal">
    If you are running this on your local machine, access `http://localhost:8009` in your browser.
    Or, if you are running this on a remote machine, access `http://<vm-public-dns>:8009` in your browser.

    <Info>
        If you can't access the developer portal from a VM, check your firewall rules and make sure the port 8009 is open or to bind properly the ports inside your network so it can be accessible.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Accessing and Getting Started with hoop.dev

Once you finish the setup, create an account and sign in to the developer portal, you will see this screen:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/docker/home-screen.png"
  />
</Frame>

#### Create your first connection

Now that you have access to the developer portal, let's create your first connection. We have a demo PostgreSQL connection that you can use to test the setup. Follow this guide to create your PostgreSQL demo.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with a Demo set up">
    In the main page click on **Quick start** button inside the **Start with a Demo Setup** area.
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/docker/home-screen-quick-start-button.png"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Interact with the PostgreSQL">
    After you click on the **Quick start** button, you will see the PostgreSQL demo connection created and ready to use with a sample SQL query.
    You can click on the **Run** button to execute the query and see the results.

    <Frame>
        <img src="images/docker/home-screen-postgres-demo-created.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>
