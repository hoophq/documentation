The desktop agent helps users execute terminal commands easily on the web app without using the terminal interface.

Download the app from [https://install.hoop.dev](https://install.hoop.dev) and get started!

## Configuration

For self hosted installations, make sure to advertise the public gRPC URL properly in your gateway.
It will ensure the app connects in the gateway properly.

<Info>
  See the `GRPC_URL` configuration on [env-vars](/configure/env-vars.mdx) documentation for more information.
</Info>

## Access your Connection

To access a connection, visit **Connections** in the sidebar and click in the **Hoop Access** Icon.
It should give access to your connection in a default port in your localhost network.
