# Connections

Connections are a central concept in Hoop.dev that serve as secure bridges between users and your organization's resources. They enable controlled access to internal services, databases, and other resources while maintaining security and compliance.

## What is a Connection?

A connection is a configurable resource that exposes internal services from your infrastructure to authorized users in a secure and controlled manner. It acts as an intermediary layer that:

- Provides secure access to internal resources
- Enforces access control policies
- Enables monitoring and auditing of resource usage
- Supports various types of services and protocols

## Types of Connections

Hoop.dev supports several types of connections:

**Database Connections**
   - PostgreSQL, MySQL and many other database systems

**Application Connections**
   - TCP forwarding, custom CLI tools, and web services

**Custom Connections**
   - Ability to create specialized connections
   - Support for complex configurations
   - Integration with custom tools and services

## Key Features

### Access Control
- Granular permission management
- Group-based access policies
- Review processes for sensitive resources

### Security
- Encrypted communication
- Credential management
- Audit logging
- Security policy enforcement

### Monitoring and Compliance
- Activity tracking
- Usage analytics
- Compliance reporting
- Integration with SIEM systems

## Connection Components

A connection in Hoop.dev consists of several components:
