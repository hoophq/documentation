# Resource Roles

Resource Roles are a central concept in Hoop.dev that serve as secure bridges between users and your organization's resources. They enable controlled access to internal services, databases, and other resources while maintaining security and compliance. Resource Roles are defined by the administrator and can be assigned to users and groups.

## What is a Resource Role?

A Resource Role is a configurable connection that exposes internal services from your infrastructure to authorized users in a secure and controlled manner. It acts as an intermediary layer that:

- Provides secure access to internal resources
- Enforces access control policies
- Enables monitoring and auditing of resource usage
- Supports various types of services and protocols

## Types of Resources 

Hoop.dev supports several types of connections:

**Databases**

- PostgreSQL, MySQL and many other database systems

**Applications**

- TCP forwarding, custom CLI tools, and web services

**Custom Resources**

- Ability to connect to specialized resources
- Support for complex configurations
- Integration with custom tools and services

## Key Features

### Access Control

- Granular permission management
- Group-based access policies
- Review processes for sensitive resources

### Security

- Encrypted communication
- Credential management
- Audit logging
- Security policy enforcement

### Monitoring and Compliance

- Activity tracking
- Usage analytics
- Compliance reporting
- Integration with SIEM systems

## Resource Components
