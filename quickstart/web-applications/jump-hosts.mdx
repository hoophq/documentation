## Connection Setup

Any agent connected in the gateway could act as bastion host. You could choose which command to expose.

### Expose Bash Shell

```sh
hoop admin create conn jump-host-bash -a <agent-name> -- /bin/bash
```

### Expose Python Shell

```sh
hoop admin create conn jump-host-python -a <agent-name> -- python3
```

## How to Use

Start an interactive session.

```sh
# bash interactive session
hoop connect jump-host-bash
```

In the same connection, one-off processes can be run as well.

```sh
hoop exec jump-host-bash <<EOF
echo "one-off execution" && env
EOF

hoop exec jump-host-python -i 'import os; print(os.environ)'
```
