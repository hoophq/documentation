## Features

The table below outlines the features available for this type of connection.

- **Native** - This refers to when a database client connects through a specific protocol, such as an IDE or client libraries through `hoop connect <connection-name>`.
- **One Off -** This term refers to accessing this connection from Hoop Web App.

| Feature | Native | One Off | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |
| Audit | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="xmark" /> |  The gateway store and audit the commands being issued by the SSH client. |
| Data Masking (Google DLP) | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | A policy can be enabled to mask sensitive fields dynamically for the output. |
| Data Masking (MS Presidio) | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | A policy can be enabled to mask sensitive fields dynamically for the output. |
| Credentials Offload | <Icon icon="check" /> |  <Icon icon="xmark" /> |The user authenticates via SSO instead of using SSH credentials. |

## Configuration

| Name | Type |Required | Description |
| --- | --- | ----|     --- |
| HOST | env-var | yes |The IP or hostname of the SSH server |
| PORT | env-var | no |The port of the SSH server, default to `22` |
| USER | env-var | yes | The username of the Linux server |
| PASS | env-var | no | The credentials of the username if password authentication is enabled in the SSH server. |
| AUTHORIZED_SERVER_KEYS | env-var | no | The private key of the user that corresponds to the public key at `$HOME/<user>/.ssh/authorized_keys` |

## Connection Setup

```sh
# ssh server must enable password based authentication
hoop admin create conn myremote-server -a <agent> --overwrite \
    --type application/ssh \
    -e HOST=10.20.30.40 \
    -e USER=root \
    -e PASS=myrootpasswd

# ssh server must enable public key authentication
hoop admin create conn myremote-server -a <agent> --overwrite \
    --type application/ssh \
    -e HOST=10.20.30.40 \
    -e USER=root \
    -e AUTHORIZED_SERVER_KEYS=file:///path/to/your/private/key
```

<Info>
  In upcoming releases, we plan to automate the management of users, keys, and passwords on the remote server.
  Additionally, our roadmap includes adding a UI for managing such type of connections.

## How to Use it

```bash
hoop connect myremote-server --port 2222
```

Connect with your local SSH client

```bash
ssh -p 2222 localhost
```

## SSH Hosts Key

To prevent fingerprint issues when connecting with the local SSH client server,
add the client host key environment variable during gateway setup.

The key must be in `PKCS#8` format and encoded as base64. You can generate a key with `openssl` utility:

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ssh_host_hoop_key.pem \
  -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
base64 -i ssh_host_hoop_key.pem
```

- `SSH_CLIENT_HOST_KEY=<base64-encoded-key>`

<Tip>
  To troubleshoot the SSH connection with hosts keys, use the `--debug` flag when running the `hoop connect` command.
  This will provide detailed information about the connection process, including any issues related to parsing the host key.
</Tip>

For more details, refer to the [environment variables documentation](/setup/configuration/env-vars).
