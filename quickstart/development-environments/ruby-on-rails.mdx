## Connection Setup

To proxy the `rails console` command, execute the following command within your root application path.

```bash
hoop run --name railsc-demo --command 'rails console'
```

To proxy ad-hoc executions add the command `rails runner -` .

```bash
hoop run --name rails-adhoc-demo --command 'rails runner -'
```

## How to Use

Users can now connect and perform ad-hoc executions.

```bash
hoop connect railsc-demo
```

```bash
hoop exec rails-adhoc-demo -i 'puts "Hello World"'
```
