## Next Steps

After choosing your resource type:

1. **Follow the setup guide** for your selected resource
2. **Configure access controls** to define who can access the resource
3. **Enable AI data masking** to automatically protect sensitive information
4. **Set up reviews** for time-based or command-level approvals
5. **Monitor sessions** through the web app to track usage and audit access
