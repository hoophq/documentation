## Connection Setup

There are multiple ways to set up a connection to Kubernetes. It will depend how do you want users to interact with it.

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="Cluster Administration">
		Cluster administration is done through the `kubectl` command line.

		- **Connection Setup**

		```bash
		hoop admin create conn k8s -a <agent> \
			-e KUBECONFIG=file://$HOME/.kube/config \
			-- xargs kubectl
		```

		The command above will allow users to execute `kubectl` commands from the Web Console.
		This is useful for cluster administration tasks.

		<Note>
			Note that `xargs` is used to pass the command line arguments to `kubectl`.
			The input is passed to `xargs` and then to `kubectl` as arguments.
		</Note>

		- **Command Line Usage Example**

		```bash
		hoop exec k8s --input 'get pods'
		hoop exec k8s -i 'rollout restart deployment/myapp -n mynamespace'
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab title="One Off Commands in Containers">
		One-off commands can be executed inside a container using the `kubectl exec` command.
		The Web Console would accept inputs that is executed inside the container.

		- **Connection Setup**

		```bash
		hoop admin create conn k8s -a <agent> \
			-e KUBECONFIG=file://$HOME/.kube/config \
			-- kubectl exec --stdin deployment/myapp -- bash
		```

		The command above will allow users to execute commands inside the `myapp` deployment.
		This is useful for running scripts inside a container.

		- **Command Line Usage Example**

		```bash
		# execute 'env' inside the default container
		hoop exec k8s --input 'env'
		# execute 'ls -l' inside the default container
		hoop exec k8s -i 'ls -l'
		```
	</Tab>
	<Tab title="Interactive Access">
		Interactive access can be achieved by using the `kubectl exec` command with the `--stdin` and `--tty` flags.

		- **Connection Setup**

		```bash
		hoop admin create conn myapp -a <agent> \
			-e KUBECONFIG=file://$HOME/.kube/config \
			-- kubectl exec --stdin --tty deployment/myapp --
		```

		<Tip>
			To narrow down the scope to a specific command, you can use the name of the command you want to run.
			E.g.: `-- bash` or `-- rails console`.

			In this example users could use any runtime command inside the `myapp` deployment.
		</Tip>

		This will allow users to open an interactive shell inside the `myapp` deployment.
		This is useful for debugging or running commands interactively inside a container.

		- **Command Line Usage Example**

		```bash
		# Open an interactive session with the deployment myapp using 'bash'
		hoop connect myapp -- bash
		# Open an interactive session with the deployment myapp using 'rails console'
		hoop connect myapp -- rails console
		```

		<Info>
			Note that `kubectl exec` is used with `-tty` and `--stdin` arguments.
			These flags are required when using `hoop connect`
