## Connection Configuration

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KUBECONFIG | filesystem | A [Kubeconfig File](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) with permission to exec into pods in a namespace |

### Connection Command

```bash
hoop admin create conn k8s -a <agent> -- kubectl
```

<Info>
The assumption is that the service account where the agent is deployed has the necessary permissions to interact with the Kubernetes API. Alternatively, create the connection passing your local KUBECONFIG. Example:
</Info>

```bash
hoop admin create conn k8s \
	-a <agent> \
	-e filesystem:KUBECONFIG=file://$HOME/.kube/config \
	-- kubectl
```

## How to Use

```bash
# view pods in the default namespace
hoop exec k8s -- get pods
# restart an app
hoop exec k8s -- rollout restart deployment/myapp
# scale up an app
hoop exec k8s -- scale --replicas=3 deployment/myapp
```

It’s possible to narrow down the commands into distinct connections; this gives a better user experience.

- Update the connection with the **command** below

```bash
hoop admin create conn k8s -a <agent> -- \
  kubectl --namespace prod rollout
```

Then it’s possible

```bash
hoop exec k8s -- restart deployment/myapp
hoop exec k8s -- undo deployment/myapp
```

# Interactive

---

`kubectl` provides ways to create interactive sessions with pods. It’s possible to map these commands to Hoop to obtain interactive sessions allocating a pseudo-TTY.

### Connection Command

```bash
hoop admin create conn k8s-exec -a <agent> -- \
  kubectl exec --tty --stdin deployment/myapp --
```

## How to Use

Start an interactive bash session with a deployment/pod

```bash
hoop connect myapp -- bash
```

This will open an interactive session with the deployment `myapp`. It’s possible to map any command that spawns an interactive session.

Then, it’s possible to gain a rails console session

```bash
hoop connect myapp -- rails console
```

<Info>
Note that `kubectl exec` is used with `-tty` and `--stdin` arguments. These flags are required when using `hoop connect`
</Info>

# One-off scripts

---

Processes can be spawned in an ad-hoc manner using `kubectl exec`. However, in some cases, an interactive shell may be overly permissive.

## Connection Configuration

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KUBECONFIG | filesystem | A https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/ with permission to exec into pods in a namespace |

### Connection Command

```bash
hoop admin create conn exec-oneoff -a <agent> -- \
	kubectl exec --stdin deployment/myapp --
```

## How to Use

This example executes a one-off process using ruby.

```bash
hoop exec exec-oneoff -- rails runner 'puts Rails.env'
```

Narrowing down the exec arguments allows passing the stdin and executing ruby scripts.

- Edit the connection **command** with the bellow content

```bash
hoop admin create conn exec-oneoff -a <agent> -- \
	kubectl exec --stdin deployment/myapp -- rails runner -
```

Then, it’s possible

```bash
hoop exec exec-oneoff <<EOF
myvar='Hello'
puts myvar
EOF
```

The connection now runs a one-off process accepting ruby scripts from the standard input.
