## Features

The table below outlines the features available for this type of connection.

- **Native** - This refers to when a database client connects through a specific protocol, such as an IDE or client libraries through `hoop connect <connection-name>`.
- **One Off -** This term refers to accessing this connection from hoop web panel.

| Feature | Native | One Off | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TLS Termination Proxy | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | The local proxy terminates the connection with TLS, enabling the connection with the remote server to be TLS encrypted. |
| Audit | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | The gateway stores and audits the queries being issued by the client |
| Data Masking (Google DLP) | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | A policy can be enabled to mask sensitive fields dynamically when performing queries in the logs. |
| Data Masking (MS Presidio DLP) | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | A policy can be enabled to mask sensitive fields dynamically when performing queries in the logs. |
| Credentials Offload | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | The user authenticates via SSO instead of using the service credentials. |
| Interactive Access | <Icon icon="xmark" /> | <Icon icon="check" /> | Interactive access is available when using an IDE or connecting via a terminal for log analysis exploration. |

## Configuration

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | env-var | yes | The AWS access key ID for CloudWatch Logs access |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | env-var | yes | The AWS secret access key for CloudWatch Logs access |
| AWS_REGION | env-var | yes | The AWS region where your CloudWatch log groups are located (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`) |

The AWS credentials require the minimal set of IAM permissions to work:
- `logs:DescribeLogGroups`
- `logs:FilterLogEvents`
- `logs:GetLogEvents`

## Connection Setup

The flag `--type custom/cloudwatch` allows displaying the introspection schema in the web interface.

```bash
hoop admin create conn my-cloudwatch -a <agent-name> \
    --type custom/cloudwatch \
    --schema=enabled \
    --skip-validation \
    -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE \
    -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY \
    -e AWS_REGION=us-west-2 \
    -- bash
```

<Warning>
    Currently, CloudWatch connections cannot be **created** through the web interface.
    Use the CLI command above to create the connection, then it will be available in the web app for use.
</Warning>

## Connection Usage

### CLI

```bash
hoop exec my-cloudwatch -i 'aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name /aws/lambda/my-function'
```

### Web panel

When you select a log group in the interface, the terminal will propagate the name as `LOG_GROUP_NAME` environment variable, allowing you to use it in your scripts.
The example above shows the variable being used in a script to filter events from the `/aws/lambda/my-function` log group.
