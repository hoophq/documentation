You can audit tracks every action made with Hoop.dev. It provides video recordings of sessions and logging.

## **Benefits**

**Faster Debugging:** Quickly identify what went wrong in a session with complete visibility into every command and response. Which means there is no need to reconstruct issues from memory or incomplete logs.

**Improved Onboarding and Knowledge Sharing:** Session recordings double as live documentation, helping new team members learn how experienced engineers navigate complex systems.

**Streamlined Compliance:** Automatically generate detailed audit trails to support SOC 2, HIPAA, and PCI compliance without setting up external log forwarding or managing multiple logging systems.

**Zero-Trust Security Enforcement:** Maintain full visibility into how access is used. Every action is tied to an authenticated user, with no standing credentials or untracked activity.

## **Key Features**

**Complete Session Capture:** Includes precise timestamps, user identity with organizational context, and connection metadata for every session.

**Full Input/Output Recording:** Records every command entered and response returned, with optional high-definition video playback and structured log export.

**Searchable Metadata:** Sessions are enriched with tags and contextual information for fast filtering, retrieval, and analysis.

**Multiple Output Formats:** View sessions as videos in the browser or export structured logs for automated processing and reporting.

## Information available

**Time**: start and end time of each session

**User**: complete user information inside your organization

**Connection**: the connection used in the session

**Input and Output**: every command and its output an user has executed

- **Video recording**: a video recording of the session
- **Logs**: a log of the session

**Capture every interaction with full visibility, faster troubleshooting, and built-in compliance.**

[Hoop.dev](http://Hoop.dev)’s session recording feature provides a complete, searchable record of user activity across your infrastructure—without disrupting developer workflows.

## **How it Works**

**Transparent Proxy Layer:** [hoop.dev](http://hoop.dev) sits between users and infrastructure, capturing all session data without changing your existing tools or workflows.

**Automatic Recording:** Session recording starts the moment a user connects through [hoop.dev](http://hoop.dev). There’s no manual setup or toggling required.

**Structured Storage and Search:** Recorded sessions are stored securely with rich metadata, making it easy to search by user, resource, or timeframe.

**Security and Access Controls:** Session data is protected by role-based access controls and integrated into your existing permission model.

## **Getting Started**

1. **Connect Resources:** Add your databases, Kubernetes clusters, or infrastructure endpoints to [hoop.dev](http://hoop.dev) using the appropriate connection strings and credentials.
2. **Enable Session Recording:** Turn on session recording globally or per-connection. Use granular policies to define what gets recorded and for how long.
3. **Invite Team Members:** Add users and assign access permissions. All activity is automatically tracked and tied to each individual.
4. **Use Existing Workflows:** Developers can continue using their preferred CLI or web interface. [hoop.dev](http://hoop.dev) captures sessions in the background—no workflow changes needed.

**Session recording turns everyday infrastructure access into a rich source of insight, accountability, and operational efficiency.**

For reliability engineering, security, and compliance teams, it’s a simple way to ensure visibility without slowing anyone down.
