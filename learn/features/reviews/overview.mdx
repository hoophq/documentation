Hoop.dev's Reviews feature adds a powerful security mechanism between your teams and critical infrastructure. Through two distinct review modes - Command and Just-in-Time Reviews - organizations can implement an additional protective barrier that validates access and operations while maintaining team productivity. This security layer acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that every critical command and access request is properly vetted before execution.

## Types of Reviews

### Command Reviews
Command Reviews provide real-time oversight of commands before execution, ensuring that potentially risky operations are properly vetted. This feature is ideal for:
- High-risk command execution
- Compliance requirements
- Training and mentoring junior team members
- Maintaining operational safety

### Just-in-Time Reviews
Just-in-Time Reviews enable time-based access control, allowing temporary elevated access to resources. This approach is perfect for:
- Temporary access needs
- Break-glass scenarios
- Controlled privileged access
- Reducing standing permissions

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Multiple layers of protection for your infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Meet regulatory requirements with comprehensive review trails
- **Flexibility**: Choose between command-level and time-based reviews
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined approval workflows that don't impede productivity
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of all review decisions and access grants

## Common Use Cases

**Production Safeguards**
