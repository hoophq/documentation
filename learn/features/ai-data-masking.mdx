Hoop.dev's AI Data Masking operates at the protocol layer, providing a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy that masks sensitive data in real-time. This feature ensures that Personally Identifiable Information (PII), credentials, and other sensitive information are protected without the need for complex rule setups.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Config Setup**: Unlike traditional DLP solutions, Hoop.dev's AI Data Masking does not require you to set up rules or policies. It automatically masks sensitive data in the data stream of any connection where AI Data Masking is enabled.
- **Real-Time Protection**: Sensitive data is masked in real-time, ensuring that no unprotected data is exposed during access sessions.
- **Customizable Fields**: After the initial setup, Hoop.dev provides a package of the most commonly used default fields. You can easily add or remove fields to tailor the masking to your specific needs.
