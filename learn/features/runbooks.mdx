Runbooks are a way to automate tasks in your organization. You can create templates that will be run against a connection runtime. Those templates are obtained from a git server source provided by you.

## How it works

A Runbook allows you to create templates that will be run against a connection runtime. Those templates are obtained from a git server source.

``` sql
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, gender, country, phone, email, income
FROM customers
WHERE customerid = {{ .customer_id
                    | description "the id of the customer"
                    | required "customer_id is required"
                    | type "number"
                    | squote }}
AND country = {{ .country
                | type "text"
                | description "the country code US; BR, etc"
                | default "US"
                | squote }}
```

The runbook above generates two inputs:
- customer_id
    - input-type: number
    - required: true
    - description: the id of the customer
- country
    - input-type: text
    - required: false
    - default-value: US
    - description: the country code US; BR, etc
