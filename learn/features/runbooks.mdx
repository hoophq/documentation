Hoop.dev's Runbooks enable your organization to automate operational tasks using reusable, version-controlled templates. By leveraging templates sourced from your own git repositories, teams can execute complex workflows with consistency, auditability, and minimal manual intervention.

## Key Features

### Template-Driven Automation
- Create and manage runbook templates in your own git repositories
- Standardize operational tasks across teams and environments
- Version control for all automation logic

### Dynamic Input Handling
- Define required and optional parameters for each runbook
- Input validation and descriptions for guided execution
- Support for default values and type enforcement

### Secure, Auditable Execution
- Runbooks execute against secure connection runtimes
- Full audit trail of every runbook execution
- Integrates with access controls and session recording for compliance

## Benefits

- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Automate repetitive or complex tasks, freeing up valuable engineering time
- **Consistency**: Ensure tasks are performed the same way every time, reducing human error
- **Compliance**: Maintain a clear record of what was run, by whom, and with what parameters
- **Visibility**: Gain insights into runbook usage and execution history

## Integration with Other Features

Runbooks work seamlessly with other Hoop.dev features:
- **Session Recording**: Every runbook execution can be recorded for full auditability
- **Access Control**: Restrict who can run or modify runbooks based on roles and permissions
- **Guardrails**: Enforce policies and prevent risky operations within runbook executions

## Example

```sql
SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, gender, country, phone, email, income
FROM customers
WHERE customerid = {{ .customer_id
                    | description "the id of the customer"
                    | required "customer_id is required"
                    | type "number"
                    | squote }}
AND country = {{ .country
                | type "text"
                | description "the country code US; BR, etc"
                | default "US"
                | squote }}
```

The runbook above generates two inputs:
- customer_id
    - input-type: number
    - required: true
    - description: the id of the customer
- country
    - input-type: text
    - required: false
    - default-value: US
    - description: the country code US; BR, etc
