Hoop.dev's AI Data Masking happens at the protocol layer. It's a zero-config DLP policy that masks sensitive data in real-time.

Unlike traditional DLP solutions, hoop.dev's AI Data Masking doesn't require you to set up rules or policies. It masks sensitive data in real-time in the data stream of any connection you set AI Data Masking according to the fields you configure.

After the setup, we automatically give you a bunch of default and most used fields, so you don't need to worry much about that part either. You can remove or add fields as much as you like. To see all fields available, check our [documentation page for all fields supported](/configure/ai-data-masking/fields).
