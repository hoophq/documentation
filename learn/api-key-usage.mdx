## Pre-requisites

 - Self-host your Hoop Gateway. Our managed instance does not support this feature.
 - Have an API Key configured in your environment variables in the following format: `<org-id>|<random-string>`

## How it works

When requesting one of the allowed endpoints, you can pass the API Key in the `Api-Key` header with the configured value.
The Gateway will validate the API Key and allow the request to proceed without the need for user authentication.

## Permissions

The API Key has admin access in the system, make sure to keep the key secure.
