## Prerequisites

- Finish [integration with Svix](/integrations/svix);
- [hoop.dev's CLI](/getting-started/cli) installed in your local machine;
- Be an admin at your hoop.dev instance
- Be in an Enterprise Plan

## Configuring

To configure Hoop to send events to your SIEM, log in with the client and create the `webhooks` plugin.

```bash
hoop login
```

```bash
hoop admin create plugin webhooks
```

After enabling it, you need to select which connections you want to emit webhook events. Let's override the plugin and enable it for an existing connection.

```bash
hoop admin create plugin webhooks --overwrite --connection bash-default
```

## Dashboard

Now, you can log in to your dashboard and start configuring endpoints while selecting the messages you want to subscribe to.

```bash
hoop admin webhooks-dashboard
```

<Info>
  Dashboard is only available when using Svix SaaS and could be only opened by administrators.
</Info>

To view any activity, interact with any connection.

```bash
hoop connect bash-default
```

Accessing the **Message Logs** link in the dashboard will display the `hoop connect` event.

### Adding Endpoints

To route these messages to your SIEM, add your public endpoint that will receive these messages. Click on the **Endpoints** link.

<Info>
Adding endpoints to a self-hosted Svix instance is only available via [svix command line](https://docs.svix.com/tutorials/cli) or api.
</Info>

<Note>
You can use [Svix Play](https://play.svix.com/) to test it first.
</Note>

Accessing the endpoint will contain the messages that have been sent to it.

### Event Types

Hoop provides the definition of each event that is sent. To access these definitions, refer to the **Event Catalog** link.

## Consuming Webhooks

Since we use Svix as our webhook service provider, they provide a guide and best practices for securely verifying and consuming webhooks.
