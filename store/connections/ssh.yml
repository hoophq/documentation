  ## Connection Setup


  ```sh

  # ssh server must enable password based authentication

  hoop admin create conn myremote-server -a <agent> --overwrite \
      --type application/ssh \
      -e HOST=10.20.30.40 \
      -e USER=root \
      -e PASS=myrootpasswd

  # ssh server must enable public key authentication

  hoop admin create conn myremote-server -a <agent> --overwrite \
      --type application/ssh \
      -e HOST=10.20.30.40 \
      -e USER=root \
      -e AUTHORIZED_SERVER_KEYS=file:///path/to/your/private/key
  ```


  ## How to Use it


  To connect automatically, it will listen to a random port and use your local `ssh` client to connect it.


  ```bash

  hoop connect myremote-server

  ```


  In the listen mode, it will listen for connections on the specified port when using the `--port` flag.


  ```bash

  hoop connect myremote-server --port 2222

  ```


  Connect with your local SSH client using another terminal window:


  ```bash

  ssh -p 2222 localhost

  ```


  ## SSH Hosts Key


  To prevent fingerprint issues when connecting with the local SSH client server,

  add the client host key environment variable during gateway setup.


  The key must be in `PKCS#8` format and encoded as base64. You can generate a key with `openssl` utility:


  ```bash

  openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ssh_host_hoop_key.pem \
    -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
  base64 -i ssh_host_hoop_key.pem

  ```


  - `SSH_CLIENT_HOST_KEY=<base64-encoded-key>`


  <Tip>
    To troubleshoot the SSH connection with hosts keys, use the `--debug` flag when running the `hoop connect` command.
    This will provide detailed information about the connection process, including any issues related to parsing the host key.
  </Tip>


  For more details, refer to the [environment variables documentation](/setup/configuration/env-vars).


  ## Known Issues


  ### Warp Terminal


  When using Warp Terminal, you might encounter issues due to its unique handling of SSH connections.

  To disable it, set this option in your bash profile or your current shell session


  ```sh

  export WARP_USE_SSH_WRAPPER=0
